Filter WooCommerce products by color, size, attribute, categories and tags. Easy to implement and use WooCommerce filters.

== Description ==

Ultimate WooCommerce Filters is a plugin that allows you to filter WooCommerce products by color, size, attribute, category or tag. Easy to set up and implement with a simple WooCommerce filter widget and WooCommerce filter shortcode.

= Key WooCommerce Filter Features =

* Filter WooCommerce products by color, with the actual colors displayed in the widget on your shop page
* Filter WooCommerce products by size
* Filter products by any attribute that you have set up in WooCommerce
* Filter products by WooCommerce categories and tags
* Include a smart product search in the WooCommerce filtering widget

It's very simple and quick to set up your WooCommerce filters. Use an intuitive color picker to select the colors for your shop and then, for each product, just check the ones that apply. It works the same way for the sizes. 

For the categories and tags, it's even easier! Ultimate WooCommerce Filters automatically recognizes the categories and tags that you already have set up in WooCommerce. It's as simple as enabling the filtering in our options. You will then automatically have all your WooCommerce categories and WooCommerce tags available as filters on your shop page.

Create a powerful, effective and practical product browsing experience for your customers with the ability to filter your products by WooCommerce attributes. This is the attributes functionality that is built into WooCommerce and that you already use to provide specific information about your products. In our WooCommerce filtering options, just enable which attributes you'd like to add to the filtering widget and they'll automatically display as filters on your WooCommerce shop page. No extra setup required. This is an incredibly useful feature that brings the WooCommerce shopping experience to a whole new level for your customers!
