Adds a form to the admin dashboard under Memberships -> Add Member.

== Description ==

Adds a form to the admin dashboarsd under Memberships -> Add Member. This form will create a new user, give them the chosen level along with an optional expiration date, and create an order based on the price entered.

Extra fields can be added to the form through the PMPro Regsiter Helper add on. Be sure to give your fields an extra parameter addmember=>true.

It is not possible at this time to also accept credit card or PayPal payment while creating users through the add member form. This feature would be great and is something we want to happen but don't have immediate plans for now.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-add-member-admin` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Navigate to Memberships -> Add Member to add a new member.
1. When viewing the member's list or user's list in the dashboard a "+ order" link will show up under the username that can be used to add a new order for an existing user through the same form.
